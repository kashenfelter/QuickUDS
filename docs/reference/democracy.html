    <h1>All Democracy Scores Dataset</h1>
    </div>

    
    <p>A dataset containing all (or nearly all) extant democracy indexes.</p>
    

    <pre class="usage"><span class='no'>democracy</span></pre>
        
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="format"><a class="anchor" href="#format"></a>Format</h2>

    <p>An object of class <code>tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 27801 rows and 79 columns.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="overview"><a class="anchor" href="#overview"></a>Overview</h2>

    
    <p>This dataset contains most democracy indexes in use today in a single panel
(country-year) file. It attempts to be as comprehensive as possible,
incorporating rarely used democracy indexes not easily available in
country-year format.</p>
<p>The measurement of democracy is complicated and controversial. This dataset
makes few judgments about what counts as a measure of democracy, as long as
it has been used in scholarly work. It thus includes dichotomous,
trichotomous, ordinal, and continuous indices; indices that focus primarily
on the "competition" and indices that focus on the "participation"
dimension of democracy; "thick" indices that attempt to measure a wide
variety of characteristics plausibly attributed to democracy; and
"minimalist" indexes that restrict themselves to the bare minimum of
competition. Four broad families of democracy measures can be
distinguished:</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="dichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#dichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Dichotomous indexes of democracy</h2>

    
    <p>These are indexes designed to distinguish between democracy and
non-democracy. Most of them follow a fairly minimalist conception of
democracy, focused on political competition while giving little weight to
the extent of the suffrage or thicker civil or economic rights. These
include the Boix, Miller, and Rosato (2012) indicator of democracy
(<code>bmr_democracy</code> and <code>bmr_democracy_omitteddata</code>); the Bernhard,
Nordstrom and Reenock index of democracy (<code>bnr</code> and <code>bnr_extended</code>),
originally developed for event history analysis (Bernhard, Nordstrom, and
Reenock 2001); Renske Doorenspleet's indicator of democracy
(<code>doorenspleet</code>), based on the Polity III data and a measure of the
extent of suffrage (Doorenspleet 2000); Freedom House's list of electoral
democracies (<code>fh_electoral</code>); the Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreeland (2013)
extension of the PACL (Przeworski, Alvarez, Cheibub and Limongi)
democracy/dictatorship dataset (<code>pacl</code>); Jay Ulfelder's indicator of
democracy (<code>ulfelder_democracy</code> and <code>ulfelder_democracy_extended</code>),
based on a recoding of the Polity IV data (Ulfelder 2012); a calculated
measure of democracy from the PIPE (Prezeworski et al 2010) dataset
(<code>PIPE_democracy</code> - use with care as it may be incorrectly calculated) and
a number of dichotomous democracy/non-democracy indicators
(<code>gwf_democracy</code>, <code>gwf_democracy_extended</code>, <code>kailitz_binary</code>,
<code>magaloni_democracy</code>, <code>magaloni_democracy_extended</code>,
<code>svolik_democracy</code>, <code>utip_dichotomous</code>,
<code>utip_dichotomous_strict</code>, <code>reign</code>, <code>wth_democ1</code>, and
<code>wth_democrobust</code>) from datasets concerned with the identification of
authoritarian regime types (Bell 2016; Geddes, Wright, and Frantz 2014;
Svolik 2012, Wahman, Teorell, and Hadenius 2013, Kailitz 2013). These are
all highly but not perfectly correlated with one another, with correlation
coefficients ranging from 0.69 (<code>magaloni_democracy_extended</code> and
<code>doorenspleet</code>) to 0.95 (<code>reign_democracy</code> and
<code>gwf_democracy_extended_strict</code>)</p>
<p>Of these, only Doorenspleet's and Bernhard, Nordstrom, and Reenock's
measures give special weight to the extent of suffrage in determining
whether a country is democratic; not surprisingly, they display the lowest
correlation with the other dichotomous indicators of democracy. All of
these indexes have world-wide spatial scope, though they differ greatly in
temporal coverage. <code>doorenspleet</code>, <code>bmr_democracy</code>, <code>reign</code>, and
the "extended" versions of <code>magaloni_democracy</code>, <code>gwf_democracy</code>, and
<code>ulfelder_democracy</code> have the widest temporal scope, going all the way back
to the 19th century and in some cases beyond.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="trichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#trichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Trichotomous indexes of democracy</h2>

    
    <p>Trichotomous indexes of democracy distinguish explicitly a "hybrid" or
"semi-democratic" category. These include the measure of democracy in
Central America developed by Bowman, Lehoucq, and Mahoney (<code>blm</code>, see
Bowman, Lehoucq, and Mahoney 2005), the trichotomous measure of democracy
in Latin America by Mainwaring, Brinks, and Perez Linan
(<code>mainwaring</code>), the "Political Regime Change" dataset (<code>prc</code>,
omitting the code for "transition" in the original dataset) described in
Gasiorowski 1996 and extended in Reich 2002; and a couple of measures taken
from datasets of autocratic regimes that explicitly distinguish between
full democracies, electoral or multiparty autocracies, and other
autocracies (<code>utip_trichotomous</code>, <code>kailitz_tri</code>). Both <code>blm</code>
and <code>mainwaring</code> are regional indexes developed by scholars with
Latin-American expertise; the rest have world-wide scope. These correlate
with each other at levels ranging from 0.70 (<code>kailitz_tri</code> and <code>blm</code>) to
0.9 (<code>blm</code> and <code>mainwaring</code>).</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="ordinal-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#ordinal-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Ordinal indexes of democracy</h2>

    
    <p>These indexes distinguish more than three "degrees" of democracy, but they
are not explicitly continuous. They include Freedom House's 14 category
freedom index (<code>fh_total_reversed</code>); the 7 category Lexical Index of
Democracy (<code>lexical_index</code>, from Skaaning, Gerring, Bartusevicius
2015); a 5 category indicator of democracy used by the Political
Instability Task Force based on the <code>parcomp</code> and <code>exrec</code>
variables of the Polity dataset (<code>pitf</code>, described in Goldstone et al
2010); the Polity IV <code>polity2</code> variable; a calculated variable from
Przeworski 2010 (<code>PIPE_regime</code> - use with care, as it may be incorrectly
calculated) Coppedge and Reinicke's Polyarchy index
(<code>polyarchy_original_contestation</code> and
<code>polyarchy_original_polyarchy</code>, from Coppedge and Reinicke 1991). Of
these, the Polyarchy measures are specialist measures that only cover 357
country-years, but the rest have worldwide scope, <code>polity</code> and
<code>lexical_index</code> go all the way back to the beginning of the 19th
century.</p>
<p>Most of these indexes are meant to capture "thicker" conceptions of
democracy. The Freedom House measure puts some emphasis on civil and
political rights; Polity and PITF focus on differences in "authority
patterns" (though they tend to downplay the scope of participation);
Polyarchy tries to operationalize both the participation and contestation
dimensions of Dahl's "Polyarchy" concept; and LIED tries to incorporate the
degree of suffrage using measures originally collected for the PIPE dataset
(Prezeworski et al 2010). They correlate with one another at levels ranging
from 0.81 (<code>lexical_index</code> and <code>pitf</code>) to 0.94 (<code>polity2</code>
and <code>pitf</code>).</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="continuous-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#continuous-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Continuous indexes of democracy</h2>

    
    <p>These indexes conceptualize democracy as a continuous quantity, and usually
in "thicker" ways. They include Arat's measure of democracy
(<code>pmm_arat</code>, from Arat 1991); Bollen's index of democracy
(<code>pmm_bollen</code>, from Bollen 2001); the World Governance Indicator's
Index of voice and Acocuntability (<code>wgi_democracy</code>); Axel Hadenius'
index of democracy, from Hadenius 1992 (<code>pmm_hadenius</code>); Munck's
measure of democracy (<code>pmm_munck</code>); several variants of the
Participation-Enhanced Polity Scores (e.g., <code>PEPS1v</code>, from Moon et al
2006); the calculated inclusion and contestation dimensions from Coppedge,
Alvarez, and Maldonado (2008) (<code>polyarchy_inclusion_dimension</code> and
<code>polyarchy_contestation_dimension</code>); several indexes from V-dem (e.g.
<code>v2x_polyarchy</code>); the posterior means and medians for the three
releases of the Unified Democracy scores (<code>uds_*</code>, Pemstein, Meserve, and
Melton 2010) and Vanahnen's index of democratization
(<code>vanhanen_democratization</code>). Of these, the Unified democracy indexes,
the V-Dem indexes, and the Polyarchy dimensions are themselves latent
variable indexes.</p>
<p>Vanhanen and PEPS give special weight to participation in the measurement
of democracy; the WGI index combines a very wide variety of indicators of
democracy. Only Vanahanen, the V-dem measure, and PEPS have long temporal
coverage; the WGI Voice and Accountability index has broad spatial coverage
but is only available for a short time series. Arat and Bollen go back only
until the 1950s, though they do have reasonable spatial coverage.</p>
<p>Correlations vary from a low of 0.26 (Munck and the WGI, 126 country-year
overlap, nonsignificant) to over 0.97 for various for V-Dem indexes. The
lowest correlations are typically with the WGI measure of democracy.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="spatial-and-temporal-organization"><a class="anchor" href="#spatial-and-temporal-organization"></a>Spatial and temporal organization</h2>

    
    <p>The state system is complicated, and not always amenable to presentation in
tabular form. Countries change name, split, get absorbed into larger units,
and are not always obviously independent. This dataset basically follows
the Gleditsch and Ward list of independent states (Gleditsch and Ward 1999,
updated by Gleditsch to 2013), supplemented by Gleditsch's tentative list
of microstates (available at
<a href='http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html'>http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html</a>). The Gleditsch and
Ward list is very similar, but not identical, to the Correlates of War list
of independent states that is commonly used in Political Science and
International Relations research; in particular, the treatment of Germany,
Yemen, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Serbia, Montenegro, and a few other
countries and their successor states differs between them.</p>
<p>I have included two different codes for each country-year: the Gleditsch
and Ward country code (<code>GWn</code>), and the COW code (<code>cown</code>), as well
as an indicator of whether the country year is considered to be "in the
international system" by Gleditsch and Ward (<code>in_GW_system</code>). Since
the Gleditsch and Ward "international system" begins with the Congress of
Vienna in 1816, country-years before 1816 are by definition not "in
system," even though this does not mean that these states were not
independent then. Care should thus be taken with the "in system" indicator
for years before 1816.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while most measures of democracy are produced only
for sovereign countries, a number of measures have also been produced,
either explicitly (the V-dem project, Freedom House) or not (sometimes
researchers do not agree on whether a country-year represents a "sovereign"
state), for non-sovereign territories. In fact in this dataset about 6415
country-years in or after 1816 are not "in system" (most of them from the
V-dem indexes of democracy); these are easily excluded by filtering the
dataset using the boolean <code>in_GW_system</code> indicator (or a logical
expression that filters data points that are not in system after 1816 but
includes those before 1816).</p>
<p>All countries are measured as of 31 December of the given year, as is the
conventional rule. Some datasets do not use this rule (e.g., Freedom House,
Geddes, Wright, and Frantz 2014), and others sometimes contain more than
one data point per year (e.g., the Political Regime Change dataset); I have
tried my best to transform their coding so that all datapoints conform to
convention, but some errors may remain.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="a-note-on-sources"><a class="anchor" href="#a-note-on-sources"></a>A note on sources</h2>

    
    <p>Wherever possible, I have used the original sources for these measures of
democracy and put them in the right panel format myself. For details, see
the <a href='https://github.com/xmarquez/democracyData'>democracyData</a> package.
There are three exceptions.</p>
<p>First, in a few cases I have relied on the replication data for Pemstein,
Meserve, and Melton (2010), which contains data I have not been able to
find elsewhere. These variables are marked <code>pmm_*</code>, and they are not
always perfectly correlated with the original data (where available). For
example, <code>fh_pmm</code> includes data for 1981, whereas
<code>fh_total_reversed</code> conventionally does not; and there are a number of
divergences between PMM's <code>pmm_prc</code> data and the <code>prc</code> dataset
available from Reich 2002 that seem to have something to do with the
treatment of country-years that include transition periods. A more extended
discussion of the differences between the PMM replication data and the
original data sources is available in a package vignette; see
<code><a href='../articles/Differences_between_PMM_and_original_data.html'>vignette("Differences_between_PMM_and_original_data")</a></code> for details.)</p>
<p>Second, I have constructed the <code>PIPE_democracy</code>, <code>PIPE_regime</code>, and
<code>pitf*</code> variables following the instructions in the source, but have
not found the data ready-made. This is probably unproblematic in the case
of <code>pitf</code> -- the instructions are very clear -- but less so in the
case of <code>przeworski</code>, where the instructions are less clear and it is
difficult to produce a test that indicates whether the variable is properly
constructed. It is also worth noting that the Polity data is occasionally
revised, so that the <code>pitf</code> variable described and used in Goldstone
et al 2010 is probably different from the <code>pitf</code> variable here for a
small number of country-years. (Similarly, <code>pmm_polity</code> and
<code>polity2</code> differ in a few instances due to revisions of the Polity
data between 2010 and today.)</p>
<p>Third, on at least one occasion I have recalculated an index from its
original sources in different ways (see the <code>utip_dichotomous</code>,
<code>utip_dichotomous_strict</code>, and <code>utip_trichotomous</code>  variables),
since the original data does not provide an unambiguous measure.</p>

 Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward scheme sometimes

    <dt>PIPE_regime</dt><dd><p>Calculated regime type variable from the PIPE dataset.
Przeworski et al. 2013. This variable is not found in the downloadable
dataset; it is calculated according to the instructions in the codebook.
The documentation gives the following instructions:
    "0 if <code>electoral_age</code> (a variable in the original dataset) is missing.
There are two distinct reasons why it may be missing: either elections are
not held regularly or they are held but the winner does not complete a term
in office or makes an autocoup. Elections are considered not to be held if
(1) there is a constitution that specifies the length of term of the chief
executive (or the legislature) and this period is exceeded by more than one
year, except for war years, (2) there is no constitution or the
constitution does not provide for elections and no elections are held
during this period.
    1 if <code>electoral_age</code> is not missing and <code>opposition = 0</code> (a
variable in the original dataset) (or <code>republic_age</code> is missing).
These are regimes in which elections are held regularly and the winners (or
their constitutional successors) complete electoral terms but either
elections are uncontested or there is one party and independents or parties
are banned and everyone runs as independent. Note that if everyone runs as
independents it is possible for the incumbent government to lose an
election, as in Swaziland in 1993. It is also possible for the incumbent to
lose if the regime had no opposition up to some time when a competitive
election occurred but the winner did not complete a term, as in Honduras in
1852. Finally, incumbents can lose when <code>regime = 1</code> if the election
was competitive but at the end of the year the opposition was suppressed,
as in Panama in 1968.
    2 if <code>republic_age</code> (a variable in the original dataset) is not
missing, that is if <code>electoral_age</code> is not missing and
<code>opposition = 1</code> (there is some minimal opposition), but no strong
alternation has ocurred (power has not changed hands).
    3 if <code>democracy_age</code> (<code>democracy_age</code> is not found in the
original dataset) is not missing, that is, the country has elections, there
is opposition, and a strong alternation -- a change in parties controlling
the government -- has occurred."</p></dd>

percent. If data on the distribution of votes are not available, the value
of this variable is calculated on the basis of the distribution of seats in
