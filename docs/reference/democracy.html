    <h1>All Democracy Scores Dataset</h1>
    </div>

    
    <p>A dataset containing all (or nearly all) extant democracy indexes.</p>
    

    <pre><span class='no'>democracy</span>

<span class='no'>democracy_long</span></pre>
        
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="format"><a class="anchor" href="#format"></a>Format</h2>

    <p>An object of class <code>data.frame</code> with 24175 rows and 81 columns.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="overview"><a class="anchor" href="#overview"></a>Overview</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>This dataset contains most democracy indexes in use today in a single panel
  (country-year) file. It attempts to be as comprehensive as possible,
  incorporating rarely used democracy indexes not easily available in
  country-year format.</p>
    <p>The measurement of democracy is complicated and controversial. This dataset
  makes few judgments about what counts as a measure of democracy, as long as
  it has been used in scholarly work. It thus includes dichotomous,
  trichotomous, ordinal, and continuous indices; indices that focus primarily
  on the &quot;competition&quot; and indices that focus on the &quot;participation&quot;
  dimension of democracy; &quot;thick&quot; indices that attempt to measure a wide
  variety of characteristics plausibly attributed to democracy; and
  &quot;minimalist&quot; indexes that restrict themselves to the bare minimum of
  competition. Four broad families of democracy measures can be
  distinguished in this dataset:</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="dichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#dichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Dichotomous indexes of democracy</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>These are indexes designed to distinguish between democracy and
  non-democracy. Most of them follow a fairly minimalist conception of
  democracy, focused on political competition while giving little weight to
  the extent of the suffrage or thicker civil or economic rights. These
  include the Boix, Miller, and Rosato (2012) indicator of democracy
  (<code>bmr_democracy</code>, <code>bmr_democracy_omitteddata</code>); the Bernhard,
  Nordstrom and Reenock index of democracy (<code>bnr</code>), originally developed for event
  history analysis (Bernhard, Nordstrom, and Reenock 2001); the Cheibub,
  Gandhi, and Vreeland (2013) extension of the PACL (Przeworski, Alvarez,
  Cheibub and Limongi) democracy/dictatorship dataset (<code>pacl_pmm</code>,
  <code>pacl</code>); Renske Doorenspleet&#39;s indicator of democracy
  (<code>doorenspleet</code>), based on the Polity III data and a measure of the
  extent of suffrage (Doorenspleet 2000); Freedom House&#39;s list of electoral
  democracies (<code>freedomhouse_electoral</code>); Jay Ulfelder&#39;s indicator of
  democracy (<code>ulfelder</code>), based on a recoding of the Polity IV data
  (Ulfelder 2012); the Political Instability Task Force&#39;s dichotomous
  indicator of democracy (<code>pitf_binary</code>) based on the <code>parcomp</code> and
  <code>exrec</code> variables of the Polity IV dataset (Taylor and
  Ulfelder 2015); and a number of dichotomous democracy/non-democracy
  indicators (<code>gwf</code>, <code>kalitz_binary</code>, <code>magaloni_democ_binary</code>,
  <code>svolik</code>, <code>utip_dichotomous</code>, <code>utip_dichotomous_strict</code>,
  and <code>wahman_teorell_hadenius</code>) from datasets concerned
  with the identification of authoritarian regime types (Geddes, Wright, and
  Frantz 2014; Hsu 2008; Kailitz 2013; Magaloni, Min, Chu 2013; Svolik 2012; Wahman,
  Teorell, and Hadenius 2013). These are all highly but not perfectly
  correlated with one another, with correlation coefficients ranging from
  0.69 to 0.95.</p>
    <p>Of these, only Doorenspleet&#39;s and BNR&#39;s measures give special weight to the extent of
  suffrage in determining whether a country is democratic; not surprisingly,
  they tend to display the lowest correlation with the other dichotmous indicators of
  democracy. All of these indexes have world-wide spatial scope, though they differ
  greatly in temporal coverage. Indexes using the Polity dataset
  as their basis (e.g., <code>doorenspleet</code>, <code>pitf</code>) have the widest
  temporal scope.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="trichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#trichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Trichotomous indexes of democracy</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>Trichotomous indexes of democracy distinguish explicitly a &quot;hybrid&quot; or
  &quot;semi-democratic&quot; category. These include the measure of democracy in
  Central America developed by Bowman, Lehoucq, and Mahoney (<code>blm</code>,
  <code>blm_pmm</code>; see Bowman, Lehoucq, and Mahoney 2005), the trichotomous
  measure of democracy in Latin America by Mainwaring, Brinks, and Perez
  Linan (<code>mainwaring</code>, <code>mainwaring_pmm</code>), the &quot;Political Regime
  Change&quot; dataset (<code>prc_notrans</code>) described in Gasiorowski 1996 and
  extended in Reich 2002; and a couple of measures taken from datasets of
  autocratic regimes that explicitly distinguish between full democracies,
  electoral or multiparty autocracies, and other autocracies
  (<code>magaloni_regime_tri</code>, <code>kailitz_tri</code>, <code>utip_trichotomous</code>). Both <code>blm</code> and
  <code>mainwaring</code> are regional indexes developed by scholars with
  Latin-American expertise; the rest have world-wide scope. These correlate
  with other at levels ranging from 0.71 to 0.9.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="ordinal-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#ordinal-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Ordinal indexes of democracy</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>These indexes distinguish more than three &quot;degrees&quot; of democracy, but they
  are not explicitly continuous. They include V-dem ordinal indexes of
  democracy (no longer included in this dataset, but available as
  <code>e_v2x_*</code> in previous versions); Freedom House&#39;s 14 category freedom
  index (<code>freedomhouse</code>, <code>freedomhouse_pmm</code>); the 7 category
  Lexical Index of Democracy (<code>lied</code>, from Skaaning, Gerring,
  Bartusevicius 2015); a 5 category indicator of democracy used by the
  Political Instability Task Force based on the <code>parcomp</code> and
  <code>exrec</code> variables of the Polity dataset (<code>pitf</code>, described in
  Goldstone et al 2010); the Polity IV polity and polity2 variables
  (<code>polity</code>, <code>polity_pmm</code>, <code>polity2</code>, <code>Polity3</code>);
  Coppedge and Reinicke&#39;s Polyarchy index (<code>polyarchy_pmm</code>,
  <code>polyarchy_reversed</code>, and <code>polyarchy_contestation</code> from Coppedge
  and Reinicke 1991); and the &quot;regime&quot; variable from Adam Przeworski&#39;s PIPE
  dataset (<code>przeworski</code>, from Przeworski et al 2010). Of these, the
  Poliarchy measure is a specialist measure that conly covers 353
  country-years, but the rest have worldwide scope, <code>polity</code> and
  <code>lied</code> go all the way back to the beginning of the 19th century, while
  the V-dem indexes go back to 1900 and include many &quot;non-sovereign&quot;
  territories (colonies, etc.).</p>
    <p>Correlations between these measures vary from a low of 0.64 (<code>pitf</code> and
  <code>przeworski</code>) to a high of 0.94 (<code>pitf</code> and <code>polity</code>). Except for the PIPE
  measure, all of these indexes are meant to capture &quot;thicker&quot; conceptions of
  democracy. The <code>freedomhouse</code> measure puts some emphasis on civil and
  political rights; <code>polity</code> and <code>pitf</code> focus on differences in &quot;authority
  patterns&quot; (though they tend to downplay the scope of participation);
  <code>polyarchy</code> tries to operationalize both the participation and contestation
  dimensions of Dahl&#39;s &quot;Polyarchy&quot; concept; and <code>lied</code> tries to incorporate the
  degree of suffrage using measures originally collected for the PIPE dataset.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="continuous-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#continuous-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Continuous indexes of democracy</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>These indexes conceptualize democracy as a continuous quantity, and usually
  conceptualize democracy in &quot;thick&quot; ways. They include Arat&#39;s measure of
  democracy (<code>arat_pmm</code>, from Arat 1991); Bollen&#39;s index of democracy
  (<code>bollen_pmm</code>, from Bollen 2001); the Economist Intelligence Unit&#39;s
  Index of Democracy (<code>eiu</code>); Axel Hadenius&#39; index of democracy, from
  Hadenius 1992 (<code>hadenius_pmm</code>), Munck&#39;s measure of democracy
  (<code>munck_pmm</code>); several variants of the Participation-Enhanced Polity
  Scores (<code>PEPS*</code>, from Moon et al 2006); continuous indexes of
  democracy from V-dem (<code>v2x_*</code>); and Vanahnen&#39;s index of
  democratization (<code>vanhanen</code>, <code>vanhanen_full</code>). Vanhanen, some of
  the V-dem indexes, and PEPS give special weight to participation; the EIU
  index combines a very wide variety of indicators of democracy. Only
  Vanahanen, the V-dem measures, and PEPS have long temporal coverage; the
  EIU has broad spatial coverage but is only available for a short time
  series. Arat and Bollen go back only until the 1950s, though they do have
  reasonable spatial coverage.</p>
    <p>Correlations vary from a low of -0.05 (Munck and the EIU, 126 country-year
  overlap) to over 0.9. The lowest correlations are typically with the EIU
  measure of democracy.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="spatial-and-temporal-organization"><a class="anchor" href="#spatial-and-temporal-organization"></a>Spatial and temporal organization</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>The state system is complicated, and not always amenable to presentation in
  tabular form. Countries change name, split, get absorbed into larger units,
  and are not always obviously independent. This dataset basically follows
  the Gleditsch and Ward list of independent states (Gleditsch and Ward 1999,
  updated by Gleditsch to 2013), supplemented by Gleditsch&#39;s tentative list
  of microstates (available at
  <a href = 'http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html'>http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html</a>), and a very small
  number of judgment calls of my own. The Gleditsch and
  Ward list is very similar, but not identical, to the Correlates of War list
  of independent states that is commonly used in Political Science and
  International Relations research; in particular, the treatment of Germany,
  Yemen, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Serbia, Montenegro, and a few other
  countries and their successor states differs between them. I have included
  both the Gleditsch and Ward country code (<code>GWn</code>) and the COW code
  (<code>cown</code>) for each country-year, as well as an indicator of whether the
  country year is considered to be &quot;in the international system&quot; by Gleditsch
  and Ward and whether it is considered to be a microstate (<code>in_system</code>
  and <code>microstate</code>; note that microstates are considered to be &quot;in
  system&quot; in this dataset). Since the Gleditsch and Ward &quot;international
  system&quot; begins with the Congress of Vienna in 1816, country-years before
  1816 are by definition not &quot;in system,&quot; even though this does not mean that
  these states were not independent then. Care should thus be taken with the
  &quot;in system&quot; indicator for years before 1816.</p>
    <p>It is worth noting that while most measures of democracy are produced only
  for sovereign countries, a number of measures have also been produced,
  either explicitly (the V-dem project) or not (sometimes
  researchers do not agree on whether a country-year represents a &quot;sovereign&quot;
  state), for non-sovereign territories. In fact in this dataset about 5091
  country-years in or after 1816 are not &quot;in system&quot; (most of them from the
  V-dem indexes of democracy); these are easily excluded by filtering the
  dataset using the boolean <code>in_system</code> indicator (or a logical
  expression that filters data points that are not in system after 1816 but
  includes those before 1816).</p>
    <p>All countries are measured as of 31 December of the given year, as is the
  conventional rule. Some datasets do not use this rule (e.g., Freedom House,
  GWF), and others sometimes contain more than one data point per year (e.g.,
  the Political Regime Change dataset gives all regime types measured in a
  single year, which sometimes results in two or three regimes when a
  transition occurs); I have tried my best to transform their coding so that
  all datapoints conform to convention, but some errors may remain.</p>
    <p>A full discussion of the temporal and geographic coverage of these
  variables, is available in a package vignette; see
  <code>vignette(&quot;Spatial_and_temporal_coverage&quot;)</code> for details.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="a-note-on-sources"><a class="anchor" href="#a-note-on-sources"></a>A note on sources</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>Wherever possible, I have used the original sources for these measures of
  democracy and put them in the right panel format myself. There are three
  exceptions.</p>
    <p>First, in a few cases I have relied on the replication data for Pemstein,
  Meserve, and Melton (2010), which contains data I have not been able to
  find elsewhere. These variables are marked <code>_pmm</code>, and they are not
  always perfectly correlated with the original data (where available). For
  example, <code>freedomhouse_pmm</code> includes data for 1981, whereas
  <code>freedomhouse</code> conventionally does not; and there are a number of
  divergences between PMM&#39;s <code>prc_pmm</code> data and the <code>prc</code> dataset
  available from Reich 2002 that seem to have something to do with the
  treatment of country-years that include transition periods. A more extended
  discussion of the differences between the PMM replication data and the
  original data sources is available in a package vignette; see
  <code>vignette(&quot;Differences_between_PMM_and_original_data&quot;)</code> for details.)</p>
    <p>Second, I have constructed the <code>przeworski</code> and <code>pitf*</code> variables
  following the instructions in the source, but have not found the data
  ready-made. This is probably unproblematic in the case of <code>pitf</code> --
  the instructions are very clear -- but less so in the case of
  <code>przeworski</code>, where the instructions are less clear and it is
  difficult to produce a test that indicates whether the variable is properly
  constructed. It is also worth noting that the Polity data is occasionally
  revised, so that the <code>pitf</code> variable described and used in Goldstone
  et al 2010 is probably different from the <code>pitf</code> variable here for a
  small number of country-years. (Similarly, <code>polity_pmm</code> and
  <code>polity2</code> differ in a few instances due to revisions of the Polity
  data between 2010 and today.)</p>
    <p>Third, on at least one occasion I have recalculated an index from its
  original sources in different ways (see the <code>utip_dichotomous</code>,
  <code>utip_dichotomous_strict</code>, and <code>utip_trichotomous</code>  variables),
  since the original data does not provide an unambiguous measure.</p>

  in CoW after the break up of Yugoslavia, whereas it becomes 340 in GWn;
  Vietnam before 1948 is 816 in CoW, but 815 in G &amp; W; and Yemen after
  unification is 679 in CoW, but it remains 678 on G &amp; W, which considers it
  a continuation of the same state (absorbing South Yemen). Finally,
  Kiribati, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Nauru have different codes in G &amp; W for

  Przeworski, Adam et al. 2013. Political Institutions and Political Events
  (PIPE) Data Set. Department of Politics, New York University. The original
  data and codebook can be downloaded from
  <a href = 'https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/adam-przeworski/home/data'>https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/adam-przeworski/home/data</a>. This
  variable is not found in the downloadable dataset; it is calculated according
  to the instructions in the codebook. The documentation gives the following instructions:</p>
    <p>&quot;0 if <code>electoral_age</code> [a variable in the original dataset] is missing.
  There are two distinct reasons why it may be missing: either elections are
  not held regularly or they are held but the winner does not complete a term
  in office or makes an autocoup. Elections are considered not to be held if
  (1) there is a constitution that specifies the length of term of the chief
  executive (or the legislature) and this period is exceeded by more than one
  year, except for war years, (2) there is no constitution or the
  constitution does not provide for elections and no elections are held
  during this period.</p>
    <p>1 if <code>electoral_age</code> is not missing and <code>opposition</code>=0 [a
  variable in the original dataset] (or <code>republic_age</code> is missing).
  These are regimes in which elections are held regularly and the winners (or
  their constitutional successors) complete electoral terms but either
  elections are uncontested or there is one party and independents or parties
  are banned and everyone runs as independent. Note that if everyone runs as
  independents it is possible for the incumbent government to lose an
  election, as in Swaziland in 1993. It is also possible for the incumbent to
  lose if the regime had no opposition up to some time when a competitive
  election occurred but the winner did not complete a term, as in Honduras in
  1852. Finally, incumbents can lose when <code>regime</code>=1 if the election was
  competitive but at the end of the year the opposition was suppressed, as in
  Panama in 1968.</p>
    <p>2 if <code>republic_age</code> [a variable in the original dataset] is not
  missing, that is if <code>electoral_age</code> is not missing and
  <code>opposition</code>=1 (there is some minimal opposition), but no strong
  alternation has ocurred (power has not changed hands).</p>
    <p>3 if <code>democracy_age</code> [<code>democracy_age</code> is not found in the
  original dataset]is not missing, that is, the country has elections, there
  is opposition, and a strong alternation -- a change in parties controlling
  the government -- has occurred.&quot;</dd></p>

  From Vanahnen&#39;s documentation: &quot;The smaller parties&#39; share of the votes
  cast in parliamentary or presidential elections, or both, is used to
  indicate the degree of competition. It is calculated by subtracting the
  percentage of votes won by the largest party from 100. If the largest party
  gets, for example, 40 percent of the votes, the share of the smaller
  parties is 60 percent. If data on the distribution of votes are not
  available, the value of this variable is calculated on the basis of the
  distribution of seats in parliament. The distribution of seats is used also
  in cases in which it seems to indicate power relations more realistically
  than the distribution of votes.&quot; Its maximum value is 70. See the full
  documentation for Vanhanen&#39;s dataset for details.</dd></p>
