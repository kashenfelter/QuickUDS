    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="format"><a class="anchor" href="#format"></a>Format</h2>

    <p>An object of class <code>tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 24136 rows and 26 columns.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="overview"><a class="anchor" href="#overview"></a>Overview</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>This dataset contains an extension of the Unified Democracy Scores of
  Pemstein, Meserve, and Melton (2010). PMM 2010 use a latent variable
  approach to combine diverse measurements of democracy for a broad panel of
  countries from 1946 to 2012; this dataset extends the scores by using more
  democracy measures with broader temporal and spatial coverage, generating
  democracy scores for 24111 country-years (224 distinct countries and
  territories), including 18329 country-years for independent, sovereign
  countries from 1816 to 2015.</p>
    <p>The measurement of democracy is complicated and controversial. The extended
  UDS makes few judgments about what measures of democracy should be used to
  generate latent democracy scores, as long as they have been used in
  scholarly work. It uses dichotomous, trichotomous, ordinal, and continuous
  indices; indices that focus primarily on the &quot;competition&quot; and indices that
  focus on the &quot;participation&quot; dimension of democracy; &quot;thick&quot; indices that
  attempt to measure a wide variety of characteristics plausibly attributed
  to democracy; and &quot;minimalist&quot; indexes that restrict themselves to the bare
  minimum of competition. Nevertheless, most of these indexes agree that
  democracy has something to do with competition and participation, even if
  they weight these dimensions somewhat differently, and even if they include
  other things, such as civil rights.</p>
    <p>The latent variable score is calculated using four broad families of
  democracy measures, all of which are available in the
  <code><a href='democracy.html'>democracy</a></code> file (variable names in this section refer to
  columns in that file):</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="dichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#dichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Dichotomous indexes of democracy</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>These are indexes designed to distinguish between democracy and
  non-democracy. Most of them follow a fairly minimalist conception of
  democracy, focused on political competition while giving little weight to
  the extent of the suffrage or thicker civil or economic rights. These
  include the Boix, Miller, and Rosato (2012) indicator of democracy
  (<code>bmr_democracy</code>); the Bernhard, Nordstrom and Reenock index of
  democracy (<code>bnr</code>), originally developed for event history analysis
  (Bernhard, Nordstrom, and Reenock 2001); Renske Doorenspleet&#39;s indicator of
  democracy (<code>doorenspleet</code>), based on the Polity III data and a measure
  of the extent of suffrage (Doorenspleet 2000); Freedom House&#39;s list of
  electoral democracies (<code>freedomhouse_electoral</code>); the Cheibub, Gandhi,
  and Vreeland (2013) extension of the PACL (Przeworski, Alvarez, Cheibub and
  Limongi) democracy/dictatorship dataset (<code>pacl</code>); Jay Ulfelder&#39;s
  indicator of democracy (<code>ulfelder</code>), based on a recoding of the Polity
  IV data (Ulfelder 2012); and a number of dichotomous
  democracy/non-democracy indicators (<code>gwf</code>, <code>svolik</code>,
  <code>utip_dichotomous_strict</code>, and <code>wahman_teorell_hadenius</code>) from
  datasets concerned with the identification of authoritarian regime types
  (Geddes, Wright, and Frantz 2014; Svolik 2012, Wahman, Teorell, and
  Hadenius 2013). These are all highly but not perfectly correlated with one
  another, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.41
  (<code>freedomhouse_electoral</code> and <code>bnr</code>) to 0.92 (<code>gwf</code> and
  <code>pacl</code>)</p>
    <p>Of these, only Doorenspleet&#39;s and Bernhard, Nordstrom, and Reenock&#39;s
  measures give special weight to the extent of suffrage in determining
  whether a country is democratic; not surprisingly, they display the lowest
  correlation with the other dichotomous indicators of democracy. All of
  these indexes have world-wide spatial scope, though they differ greatly in
  temporal coverage. <code>doorenspleet</code> and <code>bmr_democracy</code> have the
  widest temporal scope, going all the way back to the 19th century. Some of
  the countries in <code>gwf</code> are also coded far into the past.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="trichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#trichotomous-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Trichotomous indexes of democracy</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>Trichotomous indexes of democracy distinguish explicitly a &quot;hybrid&quot; or
  &quot;semi-democratic&quot; category. These include the measure of democracy in
  Central America developed by Bowman, Lehoucq, and Mahoney (<code>blm</code>, see
  Bowman, Lehoucq, and Mahoney 2005), the trichotomous measure of democracy
  in Latin America by Mainwaring, Brinks, and Perez Linan
  (<code>mainwaring</code>), the &quot;Political Regime Change&quot; dataset
  (<code>prc_notrans</code>, omitting the code for &quot;transition&quot; in the original
  dataset) described in Gasiorowski 1996 and extended in Reich 2002; and a
  couple of measures taken from datasets of autocratic regimes that
  explicitly distinguish between full democracies, electoral or multiparty
  autocracies, and other autocracies (<code>magaloni_regime_tri</code>,
  <code>kailitz_tri</code>). Both <code>blm</code> and <code>mainwaring</code> are regional
  indexes developed by scholars with Latin-American expertise; the rest have
  world-wide scope. These correlate with each other at levels ranging from
  0.70 to 0.92.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="ordinal-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#ordinal-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Ordinal indexes of democracy</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>These indexes distinguish more than three &quot;degrees&quot; of democracy, but they
  are not explicitly continuous. They include Freedom House&#39;s 14 category
  freedom index (<code>freedomhouse</code>); the 7 category Lexical Index of
  Democracy (<code>lied</code>, from Skaaning, Gerring, Bartusevicius 2015); a 5
  category indicator of democracy used by the Political Instability Task
  Force based on the <code>parcomp</code> and <code>exrec</code> variables of the Polity
  dataset (<code>pitf</code>, described in Goldstone et al 2010); the Polity IV
  <code>polity2</code> variable; Coppedge and Reinicke&#39;s Poliarchy index
  (<code>polyarchy_contestation</code>, from Coppedge and Reinicke 1991). Of these,
  the Poliarchy measure is a specialist measure that only covers 357
  country-years, but the rest have worldwide scope, <code>polity</code> and
  <code>lied</code> go all the way back to the beginning of the 19th century.</p>
    <p>Most of these indexes are meant to capture &quot;thicker&quot; conceptions of
  democracy. The Freedom House measure puts some emphasis on civil and
  political rights; Polity and PITF focus on differences in &quot;authority
  patterns&quot; (though they tend to downplay the scope of participation);
  Poliarchy tries to operationalize both the participation and contestation
  dimensions of Dahl&#39;s &quot;Poliarchy&quot; concept; and LIED tries to incorporate the
  degree of suffrage using measures originally collected for the PIPE dataset
  (Prezeworski et al 2010). They correlate with one another at levels ranging
  from 0.71 (<code>lied2</code> and <code>pitf</code>) to 0.94 (<code>polity2</code> and
  <code>pitf</code>).</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="continuous-indexes-of-democracy"><a class="anchor" href="#continuous-indexes-of-democracy"></a>Continuous indexes of democracy</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>These indexes conceptualize democracy as a continuous quantity, and usually
  in &quot;thicker&quot; ways. They include Arat&#39;s measure of democracy
  (<code>arat_pmm</code>, from Arat 1991); Bollen&#39;s index of democracy
  (<code>bollen_pmm</code>, from Bollen 2001); the Economist Intelligence Unit&#39;s
  Index of Democracy (<code>eiu</code>); Axel Hadenius&#39; index of democracy, from
  Hadenius 1992 (<code>hadenius_pmm</code>); Munck&#39;s measure of democracy
  (<code>munck_pmm</code>); one variant of the Participation-Enhanced Polity Scores
  (<code>PEPS1v</code>, from Moon et al 2006); a continuous index of poliarchy from
  V-dem (<code>v2x_polyarchy</code>); and Vanahnen&#39;s index of democratization
  (<code>vanhanen_democratization</code>). Vanhanen and PEPS give special weight to
  participation in the measurement of democracy; the EIU index combines a
  very wide variety of indicators of democracy. Only Vanahanen, the V-dem
  measure, and PEPS have long temporal coverage; the EIU has broad spatial
  coverage but is only available for a short time series. Arat and Bollen go
  back only until the 1950s, though they do have reasonable spatial coverage.</p>
    <p>Correlations vary from a low of -0.05 (Munck and the EIU, 126 country-year
  overlap, nonsignificant) to 0.91 for Bollen and Arat. The lowest
  correlations are typically with the EIU measure of democracy. These indexes
  are transformed into ordinal measures with at most 20 categories before
  using them to calculate the extended UDS, following the advice of PMM&#39;s
  original paper and the indications in their replication code. In
  particular, the following cutoffs are used before calculating the index:</p>
    <p>Arat (1991)&#39;s 0-109 democracy score is cut into 7 intervals with the
  following cutoffs: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100. The resulting score is
  ordinal from 1 to 8.</p>
    <p>Bollen&#39;s (2001)&#39;s 0-100 democracy score is cut into 10 intervals with the
  following cutoffs: 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80, and 90. The resulting score is
  ordinal from 1 to 10.</p>
    <p>The Economist Intelligence Unit&#39;s index of democracy 0-1 value is cut into
  10 categories by first rounding to the first decimal place. The resulting
  score is ordinal from 1 to 11.</p>
    <p>Hadenius (1992)&#39;s 0-10 democracy score is cut into 8 intervals with the
  following cutoffs: 1, 2,3,4, 7, 8, and 9. The resulting score is ordinal
  from 1 to 8.</p>
    <p>Munck&#39;s (2009)&#39;s 0-1 democracy score is cut into 4 intervals with the
  following cutoffs: 0.5,0.5,0.75, and 0.99. The resulting score is ordinal
  from 1 to 4.</p>
    <p>PEPS is rounded to an integer, which transforms it into an ordinal measure
  from -10 to 10 (same categories as the Polity2 score).</p>
    <p>The V-Dem polyarchy index (<code>v2x_polyarchy</code>) is cut into 20 intervals.
  The resulting score is ordinal from 1 to 20.</p>
    <p>Vanhanen&#39;s (2012)&#39;s 0-100 index of democratization is cut into 8 intervals
  with the following cutoffs: 5,10,15,20,25,30, and 35. The resulting score
  is ordinal from 1 to 8.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="spatial-and-temporal-organization"><a class="anchor" href="#spatial-and-temporal-organization"></a>Spatial and temporal organization</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>The state system is complicated, and not always amenable to presentation in
  tabular form. Countries change name, split, get absorbed into larger units,
  and are not always obviously independent. This dataset basically follows
  the Gleditsch and Ward list of independent states (Gleditsch and Ward 1999,
  updated by Gleditsch to 2013), supplemented by Gleditsch&#39;s tentative list
  of microstates (available at
  <a href = 'http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html'>http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html</a>), and a very small
  number of judgment calls of my own. The Gleditsch and Ward list is very
  similar, but not identical, to the Correlates of War list of independent
  states that is commonly used in Political Science and International
  Relations research; in particular, the treatment of Germany, Yemen,
  Vietnam, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Serbia, Montenegro, and a few other
  countries and their successor states differs between them. See
  <code>vignette(&quot;Spatial_and_temporal_coverage&quot;)</code> for details of these
  differences.</p>
    <p>I have included three different codes for each country-year: the Gleditsch
  and Ward country code (<code>GWn</code>), the COW code (<code>cown</code>), and the
  Polity IV code (<code>polity_ccode</code>), as well as an indicator of whether
  the country year is considered to be &quot;in the international system&quot; by
  Gleditsch and Ward and whether it is considered to be a microstate
  (<code>in_system</code> and <code>microstate</code>; note that microstates are
  considered to be &quot;in system&quot; in this dataset). Since the Gleditsch and Ward
  &quot;international system&quot; begins with the Congress of Vienna in 1816,
  country-years before 1816 are by definition not &quot;in system,&quot; even though
  this does not mean that these states were not independent then. Care should
  thus be taken with the &quot;in system&quot; indicator for years before 1816.</p>
    <p>It is worth noting that while most measures of democracy are produced only
  for sovereign countries, a number of measures have also been produced,
  either explicitly (the V-dem project) or not (sometimes researchers do not
  agree on whether a country-year represents a &quot;sovereign&quot; state), for
  non-sovereign territories. In fact in this dataset about 5091 country-years
  in or after 1816 are not &quot;in system&quot; (most of them from the V-dem indexes
  of democracy); these are easily excluded by filtering the dataset using the
  boolean <code>in_system</code> indicator (or a logical expression that filters
  data points that are not in system after 1816 but includes those before
  1816).</p>
    <p>All countries are measured as of 31 December of the given year, as is the
  conventional rule. Some datasets do not use this rule (e.g., Freedom House,
  Geddes, Wright, and Frantz 2014), and others sometimes contain more than
  one data point per year (e.g., the Political Regime Change dataset); I have
  tried my best to transform their coding so that all datapoints conform to
  convention, but some errors may remain.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="a-note-on-sources"><a class="anchor" href="#a-note-on-sources"></a>A note on sources</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>Wherever possible, I have used the original sources for these measures of
  democracy and put them in the right panel format myself. There are three
  exceptions.</p>
    <p>First, in a few cases I have relied on the replication data for Pemstein,
  Meserve, and Melton (2010), which contains data I have not been able to
  find elsewhere. These variables are marked <code>_pmm</code> in the
  <code><a href='democracy.html'>democracy</a></code> file.</p>
    <p>Second, I have constructed the <code>pitf*</code> variable following the
  instructions in the source, but have not found the data ready-made. This is
  probably unproblematic in the case of <code>pitf</code> -- the instructions are
  very clear, but it is also worth noting that the Polity data is
  occasionally revised, so that the <code>pitf</code> variable described and used
  in Goldstone et al 2010 is probably different from the <code>pitf</code> variable
  here for a small number of country-years.</p>
    <p>Third, I have calculated some indexes (e.g., <code>magaloni_tri</code>,
  <code>utip_dichotmous_strict</code>) myself from the original datasets.</p>
