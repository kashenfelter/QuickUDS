\title{Probability that a country-year is more democratic than another}
\usage{
prob_more(data, country1, country2, years, mean_col = "z1",
  sd_col = "se_z1", country_col = "extended_country_name",
  year_col = "year")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A UD dataset with a country_name, year, latent variable mean and
latent variable standard deviation columns at least. Little sanity checking
is performed - careful!}

\item{country1}{The first country to compare.}

\item{country2}{The second country to compare. Can be the same as
\code{country1}}

\item{years}{Either a single year, or a length 2 vector of years.}

\item{mean_col}{The name of the column that contains the mean of the latent
variable (defaults to \code{z1})}

\item{sd_col}{The name of the column that contains the standard error of the
latent variable (defaults to \code{se_z1})}

\item{country_col}{The name of the column that contains the country name
(defaults to \code{extended_country_name})}

\item{year_col}{The name of the column that contains the years (defaults to
\code{year})}
}
\value{
The probability that the first country-year in the comparison is more
democratic than the second.
}
\description{
Probability that a country-year is more democratic than another
